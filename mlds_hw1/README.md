The data should be placed in a directory name "data" which is of the same level with directory "src"

To run our program, type in the command line:                            

  cd ./src                                                                 
  ./gen-pkl.sh                                                             
  python run.py setting.txt                                                

You can get the final result in the directory name "result/final_result"

Notice: 
The test FER(%) is close to 100%, because we don't have the label of test data.  Therefore, we initialize the label as sil.
